<h1>How to make the world a better place</h1>
<p> Look around you. You can see so many problems, problems so big that they hurt and kill people. Have you ever asked that is it possible for the world to be better?
This are the steps we need to take.</p>
<h1>We need to stop pollution</h1>
<p>If we do not stop pollution it can affect the air we breath. The release of smoke into the air causes air pollution which is really bad for humans. The smoke that 
comes out of driving cars is also affecting the clean air. All the factories that are producing cars that run on fuel have to stop, instead they should make cars that
 run on electricity. We also need power stations for electric cars. The way we dispose refuse can also cause pollution. Disposal cans should be every where.</p>

<h1>We need to stop the use of money</h1>
<p>Their are many poor people all over the world and most times they end up dieing. Because of money kidnappers and thiefs are killing people and stealing from people
 for money. Anywhere you are is not safe because of thiefs and kidnappers looking for people to steal from. Imagine if the world gave things for free, people would not 
be poor. If people stop using money and give things for free things would improve and their would not be voilence.</p>

<h1>We need to change our transportation</h1>
<p>The airplanes we have are not completely safe.If we stop using airplanes there would not be any airplanes crashing. If you want to travel from South Africa to
America instead of using airplanes we can use ships instead. Sometimes you might hear that a ship crashed into a bridge, there is a solution to that. We should bridges
that can raise up for ships to pass.</p>
<h1>To the reader</h1>
<p>If you make the world a better place billons of lives can be saved.
